# Stock-Price-Prediction-End-to-End-

This is a complete machine learning project focused on predicting stock prices using both traditional time series methods and deep learning.

##  Project Goals
- Forecast future stock prices based on historical data
- Compare performance of two approaches:
  - **ARIMA** – Statistical modeling for time series forecasting
  - **LSTM** – Deep learning approach using sequential memory

##  Models Used
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Current Progress
- [x] Data Collection
- [x] Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- [x] Feature Engineering
- [ ] ARIMA Implementation
- [ ] LSTM Implementation
- [ ] Model Evaluation
- [ ] Visualization of Results
- [ ] Project Write-up and Deployment

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure
- `Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Time Series.ipynb` – Full implementation in progress

## What's Next?
- Implement ARIMA model and analyze residuals
- Prepare LSTM inputs (windowed sequences)
- Train & compare both models on test data
- Plot and visualize predictions
